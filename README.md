My HTML & CSS Learning Journey
Hey there!

This repository is basically my digital sketchbook. It's where I'm putting all the small projects and practice files I create while learning HTML and CSS. I started this to keep all my work in one place and to see how I progress over time.

It's all about getting the basics right. Everything here is built with just:

- HTML5

- CSS3

Feel free to have a look around. To see any of the pages, you can just download the files and open the HTML file in your web browser.

This is just the start for me. I'm hoping to learn JavaScript next and start making these pages more interactive.

Thanks for stopping by!
